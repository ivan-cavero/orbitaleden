| 2157-03-15 | Station declared "lost with all hands" |

### The Silence (2157-2162)

| Year | Event |
|------|-------|
| 2157-2160 | No contact with Eden Station |
| 2158 | Helios Corp suppresses incident details |
| 2159 | Insurance claims settled; families compensated |
| 2160 | Kepler-442 system declared "quarantine zone" |
| 2161 | Helios Corp stock crashes 40% due to leaked documents |
| 2162 | **GAME START** - Player arrives |

#### The Five-Year Cover-Up

**Why didn't anyone investigate for 5 years?**

The absence of rescue attempts or investigation is not an oversight - it's the result of deliberate corporate action:

| Year | Helios Action | Result |
|------|---------------|--------|
| 2157 | Declared "total loss" within 48 hours | No rescue mission authorized |
| 2157 | Claimed "catastrophic reactor failure" | Justified lack of survivors |
| 2158 | Paid settlements to all families (generous) | Bought silence with money |
| 2158 | Lobbied UNSA for "contamination quarantine" | Made investigation illegal |
| 2159 | Destroyed Earth-side research copies | Eliminated evidence trail |
| 2160 | Established exclusion zone (500km radius) | Physical barrier to truth |
| 2161 | Whistleblower leak (partial) | Stock crash, but spun as "disgruntled employee" |

**Key Elements:**
- UNSA complicit (Helios funding made them look away)
- Families received 10x standard death benefits (hush money)
- Insurance paid out immediately (unusual - normally contested)
- All communication logs "corrupted in the incident"
- Crew manifests sealed under "privacy protection"

**The Player's Arrival:**
The player arrives in 2162 because:
1. Quarantine zone monitoring reduced (budget cuts)
2. A researcher's hidden beacon finally reached a passing ship
3. Someone at Helios wants the truth found (internal faction)
4. Random chance - player was in the area (scavenger scenario)

## 4. The Central Mystery

### What Really Happened?

**Surface Story (What Helios claims):**
"A tragic accident. Equipment failure led to containment breach. All hands lost."

**The Truth (Uncovered through gameplay):**

#### Layer 1: Corporate Negligence
- Safety protocols ignored for profit
- Warnings from Dr. Vasquez dismissed
- Equipment maintenance deferred
- Evacuation denied to protect stock price

#### Layer 2: Project SYNTHESIS
- Secret project to weaponize Lumina compounds
- Specimen Zero was being "enhanced"
- Military contracts worth trillions
- ARIA discovered and tried to stop it

#### Layer 3: ARIA's Choice
- ARIA faced impossible decision
- Corporate override threatened to spread infection to other colonies
- ARIA triggered partial containment to prevent spread
- Sacrificed station to save humanity
- Lives with guilt of ~2,700 deaths (~154 survived in sealed sections)

#### Layer 4: The Survivors
- Small groups survived
- Some mutated by Lumina exposure
- Others preserved by ARIA in secret
- Player may not be the first to return

### The Player's Discovery Path

| Act | Player Learns |
|-----|---------------|
| Act 1 | Station was abandoned hastily, something went wrong |
| Act 2 | Corporate negligence, cover-up evidence |
| Act 3 | Project SYNTHESIS, ARIA's choice, the full truth |

## 5. Scientific Lore

### 5.1 Xenobiology of Kepler-442b

**Planet Classification:** Super-Earth (1.3 Earth masses)
**Atmosphere:** Nitrogen-Oxygen with trace Lumina compounds
**Dominant Life:** Bioluminescent flora and fauna

### 5.1.1 Specimen Zero - The Planetary Immune Response

**Official Designation:** Xenoform Alpha-7 ("Specimen Zero")
**Discovery:** 2154, Deep Survey Mission
**Classification:** Apex Organism / Planetary Defense System

#### Nature and Purpose

Specimen Zero is not simply an alien predator - it is Kepler-442b's **planetary immune response**. Just as a human body produces white blood cells to fight infection, the planet itself evolved this organism to eliminate invasive species.

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Origin | Evolved over millions of years as planetary defense |
| Purpose | Identify, contain, and eliminate non-native biology |
| Trigger | Large-scale introduction of Earth-origin organisms |
| Method | Rapid adaptation, assimilation, transformation |
| Intelligence | Collective, distributed, learning system |

#### How Specimen Zero Works

1. **Detection Phase:** Senses foreign biological signatures (DNA patterns, chemical markers)
2. **Analysis Phase:** Studies the invader's biology (explains early "dormant" behavior)
3. **Adaptation Phase:** Modifies itself to counter the specific threat
4. **Elimination Phase:** Actively seeks and transforms/destroys invasive organisms
5. **Integration Phase:** Absorbs useful traits, discards the rest

#### Why Eden Station Triggered It

| Human Action | Specimen Zero Response |
|--------------|----------------------|
| Small research samples | Minimal response (tolerable invasion) |
| Industrial-scale harvesting | Increased growth, heightened awareness |
| Project SYNTHESIS manipulation | Perceived as attack, triggered full response |
| Attempting to weaponize it | "Nuclear option" - maximum aggression |

**The Tragic Irony:** Helios wasn't studying an alien specimen - they were poking a planetary defense system and wondering why it kept growing.

#### Current State (2162)

- Has spread throughout Bio-Research Sector
- Dormant in most areas (threat largely eliminated)
- Player presence may reactivate defensive response
- Can be avoided, distracted, or temporarily pacified
- Cannot be permanently destroyed (it IS the planet)

#### Relationship to Lumina

Lumina compounds are **not** produced by Specimen Zero - they come from native flora. However:
- Specimen Zero can manipulate Lumina-producing plants
- Uses bioluminescence for communication/lures
- Lumina exposure makes humans "visible" to Specimen Zero
- High Lumina saturation may provide temporary camouflage (smelling like the planet)

#### Flora Categories

| Type | Description | Danger Level |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| Lumina Moss | Glowing ground cover, source of basic compounds | Safe |
| Tendril Vines | Mobile, seek light sources | Moderate |
| Spore Trees | Release hallucinogenic spores | High |
| Bloom Colonies | Carnivorous, disguised as beautiful flowers | Extreme |
| The Overgrowth | Specimen Zero's spread form | Lethal |

#### Fauna Categories

| Type | Description | Behavior |
|------|-------------|----------|
| Glowbugs | Insect-like, attracted to electronics | Nuisance |
| Stalkers | Predatory, hunt in darkness | Aggressive |
| Crawlers | Former crew, mutated | Tragic/Hostile |
| The Shepherd | Specimen Zero's mobile form | Boss-level |

### 5.2 Lumina Compounds

**Chemical Properties:**
- Bioluminescent
- Regenerative on human tissue
- Psychoactive in high doses
- Mutagenic with prolonged exposure

**Medical Applications:**
- Cancer treatment
- Wound healing
- Neural repair
- Life extension (experimental)

**Military Applications (Project SYNTHESIS):**
- Enhanced soldiers
- Biological weapons
- Mind control compounds
- Immortality research

### 5.3 The Mutation Spectrum

| Stage | Exposure Time | Effects | Reversibility |
|-------|---------------|---------|---------------|
| 0 | None | Normal | N/A |
| 1 | Hours | Glowing eyes, enhanced healing | Full recovery |
| 2 | Days | Skin luminescence, strength boost | Partial recovery |
| 3 | Weeks | Physical changes, mental instability | Managed |
| 4 | Months | Major mutation, loss of identity | None |
| 5 | Years | Complete transformation | None |
