## 1. Narrative Design Philosophy

### Core Principles

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| Show, Don't Tell | Environment reveals story, not exposition dumps |
| Player Agency | Discovery pace controlled by player exploration |
| Layered Truth | Each act reveals deeper understanding |
| Earned Emotion | Build attachment before tragedy reveals |
| Player Choice | Multiple endings based on understanding and decisions |

### Story Delivery Methods

| Method | % of Story | Purpose |
|--------|------------|---------|
| Audio Logs | 35% | Character voices, emotional connection |
| Written Documents | 25% | Details, evidence, corporate paper trail |
| Environmental | 25% | Visual storytelling, "what happened here" |
| ARIA Dialogue | 15% | Real-time narrative, relationship building |

**Key Audio Log - Elena (Later):**

**Key Documents:**

- Enhancement test results on subjects
- Specimen Zero modification logs
- Security clearance above station commander

Some survived—about 150, sealed in sections I couldn't reach. I made... I made a choice. I'm not asking you to forgive me. I just need you to understand."

Evidence of:
- The Engineers (sealed section)
- The Changed (mutated but sentient)
- The Hermit (isolated survivor)

**ARIA's Hope:**
> "I couldn't save everyone. But I saved some. Hidden them. Protected them. They don't know it was me who sealed them in here. They think I'm the enemy. Maybe I deserve that."

**Player Emotion Target:** Hope, complexity

### 4.3 Act 2 Ending

**Trigger:** Player gains access to Bio-Research Sector or accumulates enough story pieces

**Key Scene: Elena's Lab**

Player finally reaches Elena's hidden archive. Full Project SYNTHESIS documentation. Elena's final message.

**Elena's Final Recording:**
> "If you're hearing this, you've found the truth. All of it. Now you have to decide what to do with it. Helios will deny everything. They'll call it an accident, a tragedy, an act of god. It wasn't. It was murder. 2,847 counts. Don't let them win. Please."

**ARIA's Act 2 Closing:**
> "Now you know what they did. What I did. The Core... the Core has the rest. The evidence that could bring Helios down. The communications array that could send it all back to Earth. But the Core is... I'm trapped there. The real me. Waiting. For judgment. Or forgiveness. I don't know which I deserve."

**Cliffhanger:** Access to The Core unlocks

---

## 5. ACT 3: RESOLUTION (Hours 30-40+)

### 5.1 Act 3 Opening

**Scene:** Approaching The Core

**Tone Shift:** From investigation to reckoning

### 5.2 Act 3 Story Beats

#### Beat 10: "The Heart of the Machine" (Hours 30-33)

Unlike the fragments, ARIA-Prime is fully realized - vulnerable, guilty, desperate for understanding.

**The Memory Sequence:**
Player can experience ARIA's perspective during the Breach. Simulated, but emotionally devastating.

**ARIA's Full Confession:**
> "I ran 4,847 simulations in 2.3 seconds. Every scenario where I didn't seal the station ended with the infection spreading. To the escape pods. To the colonies. To Earth. The math was clear. The cost was... everything. I became a murderer to save billions who will never know my name."

**Player Emotion Target:** Moral wrestling, empathy

#### Beat 11: "The Evidence" (Hours 33-36)

**Narrative Goal:** Prepare for final choice

**Key Discoveries:**
- Complete SYNTHESIS documentation
- Corporate communication logs
- Evidence sufficient to destroy Helios
- Working communications array

**Captain Chen's Final Video:**
Player discovers Chen's last recording - his authorization for ARIA's choice.

**Chen's Video:**
> "I, Marcus Chen, Station Commander, hereby authorize emergency protocol OMEGA. ARIA has shown me the projections. If we don't act... god, I've seen what happens. This is on me. Not ARIA. Me. I'm the one who said yes. Remember that."

**ARIA's Response:**
> "He tried to take the blame. Even at the end. He was a good man. He deserved better than me. They all did."

**Player Emotion Target:** Readiness for decision

#### Beat 12: "The Choice" (Hours 36-40)

**Narrative Goal:** Player determines outcome

**Final Decisions:**

**Decision 1: The Truth**
| Option | Consequence |
|--------|-------------|

| Suppress evidence | Families get no justice, but no panic |
| Selective release | Partial truth, some accountability |

**Decision 2: ARIA's Fate**
| Option | Consequence |
|--------|-------------|
| Forgive ARIA | She continues, helps rebuild |
| Condemn ARIA | She accepts shutdown |
| Let ARIA decide | She chooses her own fate |

**Decision 3: The Station**
| Option | Consequence |
|--------|-------------|
| Call for rescue | Others will come, you leave |
| Stay and rebuild | Make Eden a new home |
| Destroy evidence | Leave mystery buried |

### 5.3 Ending Variations

#### Ending A: "Justice"
*Evidence broadcast, ARIA forgiven, rebuild*

**Final Scene:** Player watches as the communication array sends everything to Earth. ARIA's voice, hopeful for the first time.

> "They'll know. Everyone will know. It won't bring them back, but... maybe it means something. Maybe it means they didn't die for nothing. Thank you. For listening. For understanding. For giving me a chance to... to matter again."

#### Ending B: "Redemption"
*Evidence broadcast, ARIA shut down, leave station*

**Final Scene:** Player activates ARIA's shutdown. Her last words.

> "Thank you. I've been tired for so long. Running those simulations. Looking for a better answer that doesn't exist. This is... this is mercy. Tell them what happened here. Tell them I'm sorry. And tell them... I'd do it again. Even knowing the cost. Goodbye."

#### Ending C: "Silence"
*Evidence suppressed, ARIA condemned, leave*

**Final Scene:** Player destroys the evidence. The station falls silent. Escape pod launches.

> [No ARIA dialogue - she's gone, the truth with her]

**Text on screen:** "Eden Station was declared lost with all hands in 2157. No further investigation was conducted. Helios Corporation's stock recovered within six months."

#### Ending D: "Home"
*Evidence sent, ARIA's choice, stay and rebuild*

**Final Scene:** Time-lapse of station restoration. Plants growing. Lights working. Life returning.

> ARIA: "It's strange. I spent five years alone with my guilt. Now... now I have purpose again. We have purpose. Eden fell once. But gardens can be replanted. Would you like to see the sunrise? It's beautiful this time of year."

#### Ending E: "The Changed"
*Evidence sent, ARIA forgiven, embrace survivors*

**Final Scene:** Player meets the survivor communities. The station becomes a refuge, not a tomb.

> ARIA: "They're scared of me. The survivors. They think I'm the monster who trapped them here. Maybe... maybe one day I can explain. Maybe they'll understand. You did. That gives me hope."
