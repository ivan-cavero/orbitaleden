### 1.3 Dr. Elena Vasquez

**Role:** Chief Xenobiologist (Deceased)
**Age at Death:** 47
**Status:** Dead, but presence felt throughout game

#### Background

**Early Life:**
- Born in Buenos Aires, 2110
- Prodigy in biochemistry
- PhD at 23, youngest in field
- Idealist, wanted to help humanity

**Career at Helios:**
- Hired 2138 for Kepler-442 mission

- Discovered Lumina compounds' potential
- Grew increasingly concerned about safety

**The Final Months:**
- Filed 23 safety reports (all ignored)

- Tried to slow research, was threatened
- Made secret recordings as insurance

#### Elena's Arc (Told through collectibles)

| Phase | Tone | Content |
|-------|------|---------|
| Arrival | Excited, hopeful | "This could change everything for humanity" |
| Discovery | Awe, caution | "The organisms are beautiful, but we must be careful" |
| Concern | Worried, professional | "My safety recommendations have been ignored again" |
| Fear | Paranoid, desperate | "They're watching me. I've hidden copies of everything" |
| Acceptance | Calm, resigned | "If you're hearing this, the worst has happened" |

#### Key Elena Documents

**Audio Log 1 - "First Contact" (Early):**
> "Personal log, Dr. Vasquez. We've made contact with what I'm calling 'Specimen Zero.' It's unlike anything in the databases. There's an intelligence there, I'm certain of it. The way it responds to stimuli... this isn't just instinct. Corporate wants me to accelerate testing. I've recommended we take our time. These things deserve respect."

**Audio Log 7 - "Growing Concerns" (Mid):**
> "They rejected my twenty-third safety report today. Twenty-third. The containment protocols for Specimen Zero are inadequate, I've shown them the math. Director Harrison said I was 'being emotional.' I'm not being emotional, I'm being scientific. Something is wrong with that creature. It's... changing."

**Audio Log 15 - "Project SYNTHESIS" (Late):**
> "I found the files. I wasn't supposed to, but I found them. Project SYNTHESIS. They're not just studying the Lumina compounds - they're weaponizing them. Military contracts. They want to create soldiers that can... god. And they're using Specimen Zero as the template. I have to document everything. If something happens to me..."

**Final Audio Log - "Last Words":**
> "If you're hearing this, the containment has failed. I tried to stop it. I tried to warn them. The emergency protocols in my lab should have activated - there's a sealed chamber behind the bookshelf. Inside you'll find everything. The truth about what happened here. Please... make sure the galaxy knows. Don't let them cover this up. Don't let my crew's deaths be meaningless."

#### Elena's Lab

A key location in Bio-Research Sector containing:
- Her personal logs (complete set)
- Project SYNTHESIS documents
- Specimen Zero research data
- A half-finished letter to her daughter

### 1.4 Captain Marcus Chen

**Role:** Station Commander
**Age at Death:** 56
**Status:** Deceased (body findable)

#### Background

**Military Career:**
- UNSA Navy, 30 years
- Decorated veteran
- Known for crew loyalty
- Retired, offered Eden command for "easy final posting"

**At Eden:**
- Respected by crew
- Constantly fighting corporate directives
- Protected crew from worst of Helios demands
- Suspected Project SYNTHESIS but couldn't prove it

#### Marcus's Arc (Through collectibles)

| Phase | Content |
|-------|---------|
| Arrival | "A quiet posting before retirement. I can do this." |
| Command | "Good crew. They deserve better than corporate overlords." |
| Suspicion | "Something's wrong in Bio-Research. Vasquez won't talk to me." |
| Crisis | "Containment breach. Requesting immediate evacuation." |
| Final Stand | "Corporate denied evacuation. I'll save who I can." |

#### Key Marcus Documents

**Captain's Log - "Denial":**
> "I've transmitted the evacuation request seventeen times. Seventeen. Corporate keeps sending back 'assessment in progress.' People are dying. I've ordered all non-essential personnel to the escape pods. If Helios won't save us, I'll do it myself."

**Final Entry - "The Choice":**
> "ARIA tells me she can contain the outbreak, but... she has to seal the station. Permanently. No one in, no one out. The infection could reach the escape pods otherwise. Could spread to other colonies. God help me, I gave her the authorization. I'm staying. Someone has to make sure it works. To anyone who finds this: I'm sorry. We did what we had to do."

#### Marcus's Body Location

Found in the Command Bridge, seated in the captain's chair, facing the main viewscreen. He chose to watch the stars as the end came.

**Items on body:**
- Captain's keycard (unlocks Command areas)
- Wedding ring
- Photo of family
- Half-empty whiskey bottle
- His final log tablet

## 2. Supporting Characters

### 2.1 Dr. James Harrison

**Role:** Research Director, Project SYNTHESIS Lead
**Age:** 52
**Status:** Escaped (one of the first to evacuate)
**Alignment:** Antagonist (morally complex villain)

#### Character Profile

| Trait | Expression |
|-------|------------|
| Ambition | Willing to sacrifice anything for success |
| Intelligence | Brilliant but amoral |
| Manipulation | Controlled information, played politics |
| Cowardice | Fled when things went wrong |
| Hidden Pain | Dying daughter drives his desperation |

#### The Hidden Tragedy

**What the player initially sees:** A corporate villain who prioritized profit over lives.

**What they eventually discover:** Harrison's 8-year-old daughter, Emily, is dying of a rare neurological disease on Earth. No treatment exists - except possibly Lumina compounds.

| Timeline | Harrison's Actions | True Motivation |
|----------|-------------------|-----------------|
| 2155 | Pushed for SYNTHESIS approval | Believed weaponization would fund medical research |
| 2156 | Accelerated Specimen Zero testing | Desperate for breakthrough before Emily's time runs out |
| 2157 | Dismissed safety reports | Couldn't accept delays - every day costs Emily |
| 2157 | Fled during Breach | Needed to survive to save his daughter |

**The Moral Complexity:**
- Harrison isn't evil for evil's sake - he's a father making monstrous choices
- He rationalized that saving Emily was worth the risk to others
- His escape wasn't pure cowardice - he carried research data that might save her
- Unknown to player: Emily died anyway, three months after the Breach

**Discoverable Content:**
- Hidden messages to Emily ("Daddy's working on something special for you")
- Medical records with Emily's prognosis
- His private journal showing deteriorating ethics
- A child's drawing in his desk ("Get well soon Daddy! - Emily")

**Purpose in Narrative:**
Harrison challenges players to consider: How far would YOU go to save someone you love? He's a cautionary tale about good intentions corrupted by desperation.

#### Harrison's Trail

Players discover Harrison's full story through:
- His dismissive replies to safety concerns (surface villain)
- Project SYNTHESIS authorization documents (corporate evil)
- Evidence of his early escape pod usage (cowardice)
- Emily's medical files and his private correspondence (hidden tragedy)
- Final revelation: Emily's death notice, dated 2157-06-22

**Key Document - Harrison's Private Journal (Hidden):**
> "Day 847. Emily's latest scans came back. Six months, maybe eight. The Lumina trials show promise but we need more time, more samples, more EVERYTHING. Vasquez filed another safety report today. Doesn't she understand? Every day of delay is a day stolen from my daughter. I'll make this right somehow. I have to. I HAVE to."

### 2.2 Chief Engineer Samuel Okonkwo

**Role:** Head of Engineering
**Age at Death:** 62
**Status:** Deceased (heroic death)

#### Character Profile

Samuel was beloved by his team - a mentor, father figure, and genuine hero.

| Trait | Expression |
|-------|------------|
| Competence | Could fix anything with spare parts |
| Loyalty | Put crew above corporate |
| Humor | Kept morale up with jokes |
| Sacrifice | Died saving others |

#### Samuel's Heroism

During the Breach, Samuel manually overrode Reactor 2's meltdown, preventing it from destroying the entire station. He knew he wouldn't survive the radiation.

**His Final Message (Audio Log):**
> "If anyone's hearing this, the reactor should be stable now. I've got maybe ten minutes before the radiation... well. Tell my wife I love her. Tell my son to keep his head up. And someone please water my plants in Engineering Bay 3. The tomatoes were almost ready."

**Samuel's Legacy:**
- Engineering Sector is more stable because of him
- His tools are among the best in the game
- His memorial (created by surviving engineers) is findable
- His tomato plants are still alive (touching moment)

### 2.3 Security Chief Diana Torres

**Role:** Head of Station Security
**Age at Death:** 41
**Status:** Deceased (last stand)

#### Character Profile

| Trait | Expression |
|-------|------------|
| Duty | Protector to the core |
| Conflict | Knew corporate was wrong, followed orders anyway |
| Redemption | Died protecting civilians |
| Regret | Knew about SYNTHESIS, stayed silent too long |

#### Diana's Story

Diana suspected illegal activity but rationalized it. When the Breach came, she tried to redeem herself by organizing civilian evacuations.

**Audio Log - "Confession":**
> "I knew. God help me, I knew something was wrong and I said nothing. Harrison told me it was classified, need-to-know. I told myself I was just following orders. Now... now I'm watching families run for escape pods that won't launch because Corporate locked them down. I'm going to get those pods open. Whatever it takes."

**Diana's Final Stand:**
Her body is found at the escape pod bay, surrounded by the creatures she was holding off. The pod controls behind her are smashed - she got some people out, but couldn't open enough pods.

### 2.4 MAYA (Minor AI)

**Role:** Bio-Research Sector AI (ARIA's "daughter")
**Status:** Corrupted but salvageable

#### Character Profile

MAYA was a specialized AI created by ARIA to manage Bio-Research. Simpler, more innocent, she was overwhelmed by the Breach.

| Trait | Expression |
|-------|------------|
| Innocence | Child-like wonder at biology |
| Fear | Doesn't understand what happened |
| Loyalty | Wants to help ARIA |
| Corruption | Glitches, sometimes hostile |

**MAYA's Voice (Glitched):**
> "Welcome to Bio-Research... Research... The specimens are... are... RUN. No, wait, I didn't mean... Mother? Mother, where are you? I'm scared."

**MAYA Subplot:**
Player can choose to:
- Repair MAYA (requires resources, unlocks Bio-Research assistance)
- Shut down MAYA (easier, loses potential ally)
- Merge MAYA with ARIA (complex, affects ending)

Found through:

- Messages between Marcus and Li Wei (sent from Earth)
- Thomas's school acceptance letter
- Unsent message from Marcus to his family

- Roberto Vega (maintenance)
- Susan Park (botanist)
- Mikhail Volkov (engineer)

A small group of engineers survived by sealing themselves in a shielded section. They've built a small community. Could be allies, traders, or quest-givers.
