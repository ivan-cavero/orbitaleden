| Tension → Relief cycles | Every 2-3 hours, reward with victory |
| Information drip | Never overwhelm, always tease |
| Earned power | Each upgrade feels meaningful |
| Player agency | Multiple paths to same goals |
| Breathing room | Cozy moments after intense sections |

The atmospheric processor in Section 7-B is failing. You have approximately four hours of breathable air in this sector. I suggest you address that. I'll... be watching."

Bio-Research has answers about what went wrong. Both are dangerous. Both are necessary. I cannot accompany you in the same way. My... presence is fragmented outside this sector. Choose wisely. And... be careful. I've grown accustomed to your life signs on my sensors."

**Player Choice:**

With all my memories. Including the ones I wish I could forget. When you enter, you'll meet the real me. And you'll learn what I did. I'm not asking you to forgive me. I'm asking you to understand.
