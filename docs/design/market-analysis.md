## 2.1 Survival & Automation: Quantitative Data

### Open World Survival Craft (OWSC)

According to 2025 market analyses, the OWSC genre maintains a dominant position in terms of commercial viability.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Success Rate (1,000+ reviews) | 20.8% |
| Revenue Correlation | $150,000+ USD at 1,000 reviews |
| Market Status | Competitive but audience remains voracious |

**Insight:** Despite a slight decrease in total successful launches, OWSC has the highest probability of reaching 1,000 reviews. The audience continues to seek innovative twists on the formula.

### Automation Genre

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Success Rate (1,000+ reviews) | 1.19% |
| Market Status | Saturated |

**Critical Lesson:** Automation alone is no longer sufficient. The genre needs external pressure context (combat, survival) to stand out.

### The "Cozy" Factor

The "Cozy" tag has evolved from a subgenre to a transversal gameplay modality. Players seek progression systems that allow "opting in" to relaxation after overcoming challenges.

**Key Drivers:**
- Agricultural mechanics
- Base decoration
- Long-term retention through personalization

## 2.2 Competitor Analysis & Strategic Differentiation

| Title | Core Mechanic | Market Limitation | Orbital Eden Strategy |
|-------|---------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **Green Hell** | Extreme body micro-management (carbs, parasites, wounds) | Punitive difficulty curve; alienates casual players; no late-game automation | Adopt diagnostic system but allow technology to automate it (e.g., auto bio-scanners vs manual inspection) |
| **Satisfactory** | First-person massive factory building | Static world; trivial combat; no real survival pressure | Introduce vital risks. Factory is life support, not just production. Power failure = oxygen failure. |
| **Abiotic Factor** | Scientific facility survival; Metroidvania progression | Crafting is mostly manual; limited automation compared to factory games | Use interconnected level design but replace manual workbenches with automated assembly lines |
| **Star Rupture** | Automation with tower defense and natural disasters | Intense focus on combat/defense; less emphasis on "habitability" | Balance defense with domestication. Allow permanent safe zones where cozy aesthetics flourish |
| **Stardew Valley** | Farming, relationships, seasonal cycles | Traditional rural theme; simplistic combat | The "farm" is a xenobotany lab. Alien crops provide compounds for advanced medicine, not just money |

## 2.3 The "Create to Play" Paradigm

The 2025 industry moves toward "Create to Play," where players expect robust tools to personalize their experience.

**In a Space Survival Context:**
- Design not just base aesthetics, but survival system logic
- Logic circuits and visual programming (similar to Stationeers/Factorio)
- Players "program" their own safety

### Implementation Opportunities

| Feature | Player Benefit |
|---------|---------------|
| Logic Networks | Custom automation rules |
| Circuit Design | Self-designed safety systems |
| Visual Programming | Accessible complexity management |
