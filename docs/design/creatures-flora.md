## 1. Xenobiology Overview

### The Lumina Ecosystem

All life on Kepler-442b evolved around **Lumina compounds** - bioluminescent biochemicals that serve as both energy source and communication medium. The alien ecosystem operates on principles fundamentally different from Earth biology:

| Earth Biology | Kepler-442b Biology |
|---------------|---------------------|
| Photosynthesis | Luminasynthesis (converts Lumina radiation) |
| DNA-based | Crystal-lattice molecular structure |
| Carbon lifecycle | Lumina compound lifecycle |
| Predator/Prey | Symbiotic networks + parasitism |
| Individual organisms | Colony-minds common |

### Threat Classification System

| Level | Description | Examples | Combat Approach |
|-------|-------------|----------|-----------------|
| **0 - Harmless** | No threat, ambient life | Glowbugs, Lumina Moss | Harvesting |
| **1 - Nuisance** | Minor damage, annoying | Tendril Vines, Spore Clouds | Avoidance/quick kill |
| **2 - Dangerous** | Significant threat | Stalkers, Bloom Colonies | Prepared combat |
| **3 - Deadly** | Lethal without preparation | Crawlers, Alpha Stalkers | Strategic approach |
| **4 - Boss** | Story encounter | The Shepherd | Full preparation |

   - Fire-based weapons most effective
   - Lumina Blade deals bonus damage
   - Combat Stims for Phase 3

2. **Arena Mechanics:**
   - Use environment for cover
   - Destroy Overgrowth connections to prevent healing
   - Lesser creatures drop ammo/healing

3. **Key Moments:**
   - Phase transitions have brief vulnerability windows
   - Core only exposed after major attacks
   - Final hit triggers cutscene

**Drops:**
| Item | Quantity | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| Shepherd Fragment | 3 | Tier 4 crafting |
| Dark Matter Residue | 2 | Ultimate tech |

### 5.2 Symbiotic Relationships

| Relationship | Species A | Species B | Nature |
|--------------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| Mutualism | Glowbugs | Lumina Moss | Pollination-like |
| Parasitism | Lumina Parasites | All organisms | Energy extraction |
| Commensalism | Tendril Vines | Spore Trees | Structural support |
| Competition | Stalkers | Crawlers | Territory disputes |

### 5.3 Specimen Zero Integration

All organisms are ultimately connected to Specimen Zero through Lumina compound networks:

- **The Overgrowth** spreads compounds through air and surfaces
- Creatures exposed to concentrated Lumina become more aggressive
- Long-term exposure leads to absorption into the collective
- The Shepherd "shepherds" creatures toward the Overgrowth

## 7. Design Notes for Implementation

### 7.1 Audio Design Guidelines

| Creature | Key Sounds |
|----------|------------|
| Glowbugs | Soft buzzing, chimes |
| Stalkers | Clicking, growls, screech |
| Crawlers | Distorted words, crying, shuffling |
| Shepherd | Multiple voices, deep rumble, screams |

### 7.2 AI Behavior Priorities

```
1. Self-preservation (flee when HP low)
2. Territorial behavior (defend area)
3. Predatory behavior (hunt player)
4. Ambient behavior (patrol, feed)
```

### 7.3 Spawn Balancing

| Area | Max Concurrent | Types |
|------|----------------|-------|
| Hub | 2 | Glowbugs only |
| Engineering | 4 | Drones, occasional Crawler |
| Bio-Research Outer | 6 | All flora, Stalkers, Glowbugs |
| Bio-Research Deep | 8 | All creatures, no safe zones |
| Core | 3 | Crawlers, scripted Shepherd |
