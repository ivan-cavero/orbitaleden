# Executive Summary

## The Convergence of Three Worlds

Orbital Eden represents a comprehensive design, market analysis, and technical architecture for a multiplayer survival game developed in Godot 4. This project capitalizes on a unique market opportunity ("Blue Ocean") identified in the 2025-2026 industry landscape: the intersection between extreme biological survival (Green Hell), the logistical satisfaction of automation (Satisfactory, Star Rupture), and the emotional retention of "cozy" games (Stardew Valley).

## Core Premise

**Automation as Relief Mechanism**

Unlike traditional factory games where production is the goal itself, in Orbital Eden, automation is the only barrier between the player and detailed biological and psychological death. 

The player begins in a "hardcore" survival situation:
- Parasite management
- Oxygen scarcity
- Sanity deterioration

Through automated system construction, they transform their hostile environment into a safe "cozy" sanctuary.

## Market Opportunity

| Genre | Success Rate (1,000 reviews) | Insight |
|-------|------------------------------|---------|
| Open World Survival Craft | 20.8% | Highest probability of success |
| Pure Automation | 1.19% | Saturated; needs external pressure |
| Cozy Games | Transversal | Players want to "opt-in" to relaxation |

**Key Insight:** The automation genre alone is saturated. Success requires combining automation with external survival pressure.

## Development Methodology

To achieve the required content scale (40h story, 80+ hours total gameplay) with a small or solo team, Orbital Eden employs a production methodology based entirely on Artificial Intelligence:

- **"Vibecoding"** - Natural language-driven development
- **AI Asset Generation** - 3D/2D models, textures, audio
- **Procedural Narrative** - AI-generated lore and dialogue

This approach leverages Godot 4's specific capabilities and integration with modern tools via the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

## Target Experience

| Phase | Experience |
|-------|------------|
| Early Game | Tension, scarcity, manual survival |
| Mid Game | Relief through first automated systems |
| Late Game | Sanctuary building, cozy farming, industrial scale |

**The Fantasy:** "Survive the horror, build your paradise."

---

## Technical Foundation

- **Engine:** Godot 4.x
- **Architecture:** Component-based, signal-driven
- **Network:** Hybrid high-level/low-level approach
- **AI Integration:** MCP servers for real-time project context

---

## Commercial Targets

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Initial Price (EA) | $19.99 USD |
| Full Release Price | $29.99 USD |
| Review Goal | 1,000+ reviews |
| Revenue Threshold | $150,000+ USD |

---

## Next Steps

1. Validate technical prototype (1000+ items on conveyor belts in multiplayer)
2. Establish MCP connection for AI-assisted development
3. Create vertical slice demonstrating core loop
4. Begin Steam playtest program
